# BankList
UserBankList application with ( Servlet, Maven, JDBC, MySQL, TomCat)
## Hello! 
### It's my Java Application.
I will talk about some aspects of this application before you launch it.
1. I used my DB for this app. You can find SQL scripts in 'ext' package. I used MySql DB, be careful.
2. Also, you can find screens of my app in 'ext' package.
3. I used (connection pooling), and all this pooling depends on Tomcat. If you want check code or test, remake connection. All code for remaking you can find in Main.class
4. There are moments that I would like to finalize, and I will definitely finalize:)
